        <h2> "Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again" - C.S. Lewis</h2>
        <p>
            Heroes have been around since pratically the dawn of time. People have always found those who rise above the rest and look up to them. 
            For the Greeks, it was their heroes in mythology.
            For the Romans it was the Cesear.
            For the modern American it can be celebrities, models, movie stars, etc.

            One of the people I most admire from history is C.S. Lewis. 
            He was a British writer and lay theologian who was close friends with J.R.R. Tolkien (author of lord of the rings.) You may know Lewis from his most famous series The Chronicles of Narnia
            This two men were some of the most influential authors in the realm of fantasy and theologian writings.
            C.S. Lewis was a man who firmly held on to what he believed, and even when he fell away, he wasn't too proud to admit his wrong doings.
            
            My heroes are the people who use their life experiences, their troubles, their short comings, to help others. People who are willing to listen to those who love the, even if it is difficult to hear. People who know how precious and wonderful relationships are and what you have to do to protect them.
            
            Heroes are those who inspire others, leading them on to change the world. But they are also there to be a supporting role and serve others. And above all they know which was is called for the most.
            
           
            C.S. Lewis embodies these traits I value so much. Not to mention I love his books and always will.
