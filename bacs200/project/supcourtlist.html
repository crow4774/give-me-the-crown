                        <p>In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue certain judicial writs.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution did not give the Court this power. </p>
                        <p>Because the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, the Court held that any contradictory congressional Act is without force.</p>
                        <p>The ability of federal courts to declare legislative and executive actions unconstitutional is known as judicial review.</p>

                    <h2>Miranda v. Arizona (June 13, 1966) <em>Holding: Police must inform suspects of their rights before questioning.</em></h2>
                 <p>Background:Ernesto Miranda, a Mexican immigrant living in Phoenix, Arizona, was identified in a police lineup by a woman, who accused him of kidnapping and raping her.</p>
                <p> Miranda was arrested and questioned by the police for two hours until he confessed to the crimes. During the interrogation, police did not tell Miranda about his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination or his Sixth Amendment right to an attorney.</p>
                <p>The case went to trial in an Arizona state court and the prosecutor used the confession as evidence against Miranda, who was convicted and sentenced to 20 to 30 years in prison. Miranda's attorney appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction.</p>
                <p>Then he appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear it along with four similar cases.</p>
                <p>In taking the case, the Court had to determine the role police have in protecting the rights of the accused guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>
                <p>Decision: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Miranda. This decision gave rise to what has become known as the Miranda Warning. While jurisdictions have their own regulations as to the precise warning given to a person interrogated in police custody, the typical warning states:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0 text-center">"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?"</p>
