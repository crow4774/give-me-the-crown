    <h1>Amusement</h1>
    <p>by Joanna Crownover</p>

    <p>Hopefully you will find some of these things as funny as I do. But most likely not.</p>
   

    <h2>Anti-Jokes</h2>
    <p>This site has things know as anti-jokes. Anti-humor is when the joke-teller delivers the punchline that is usually intentionally not funny. And because of this, the joke now becomes funny. Bewarned some of these you might considered offensive or dark humor related. But hey, I think some of the are funny. Do you agree?</p>
